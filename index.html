    <h1>People Who Attempted To Explain Evolution</h1>


                     <img src="images evolution.jpg">





<p>Jean Baptist De Mark(Lamarkism)</p>
<p>Charles Darwin(natural selection)</p>
<p>Stephen Jay Gould & Niles Eldredge(panctuated Equilibruim)</p>









<img src="images Jean Baptist De Lamarck.jpg">


<p>The theory of Larmakism-Larmarck proposed theories like the inheritance of acquired characters,use and disuse,and increase in complexity.</p>
<p>law of use and disuse</p>
<P>*law of use-the principle that the more an association is used,the stronger it becomes</P>
<p>*the complementary law of disuse states that the less an association is used,the weaker it becomes.</p>









                                   <img src="images Charles Darwin.jpg">












<p>The Law of Darwism-Is a theory of biological evolution developed by the english naturalist Charles Darwism 1809-1889 and others,stating that all species of organism arise and develop through the natural selection of small,inherited variation that increase the individual ability to compete, survive and produce.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin undertook a five year Voyage on a ship HMS Beagle as unpaid worker studying the plants and animals he came came across on his ship.</p>

<p>during his trip he came across the galapagos finches and the galapagos tortoise</p>

<p>Terms in this set(6)</p>

<p>competition, adapation,variation, overproduction, speciation</p>

<p>*competition; demand by the organisms for limited environmental resource such as nutrients, living space or light.</p>
<p>*adaptation; inherited characteristic that increase chance of survival</P>
<p>*variaton;difference between cells,individual organism,or group of organism of any species coused either by genetic differences [genotypc variation]</p>

<p>*overproduction</p>

<p>Pactuated Equilibruim-The conceptof panctuated equilibrium was,to some, a radial new idea when first proposed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles  Eldredge in 1972.Now it is widely recognized as a useful model for one kind of evolutionary change</p>
<p>Panctuated Equlilibrium-IS the theory that proposes that once a species appears in the fossil record,the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geogical history.</p>
